<p>What if you could be a divinity?</p>
<p>What if it cost you everything?</p>
<p>What if you faced monsters more terrible than you could imagine?</p>
<p>What if those monsters might be your salvation?</p>
<p>The sun has died...<br /> Not a planet, not a star shines n the black heavens above The Night Land.</p>
<p>In its midst The Last Redoubt, a vast, pyramid-shaped arcology, stands obdurate against the night, while within it the remnant millions of humanity live and thrive. The Days of Light are less than a legend to them, mouldered to dust amidst the chaos of ancient libraries.</p>
<p>Outside, strange immense and malevolent entities watch — and wait.</p>
<p>The Last Redoubt has stood ten million years and may stand ten million years more - but its final fall is inevitable. The last age is drawing to its close and the end of everything comes ever nearer.</p>
<p>The people of the Last Redoubt face this fate with stoicism, hedonism, heroic folly... except for two secretive orders who are making plans for survival and have found their champions, a man and a woman who will together carry the essence of humanity beyond the end of night.</p>
<p>But can they preserve their own humanity as well?</p>

<p class="story-teaser">I expected a whole series of tales from John set in his version of The Night Land, but his next story was a radical departure from anything that he or any of the rest of us had ever done. It surpassed not only Hodgson's talents but, damn it, Lovecraft's. When I read "Awake in the Night" I felt some envy, but when the ms for "The Last of All Suns" crossed my inbox I felt something like awe.</p>

<p class="story-teaser">She did not fully understand it yet, but she had a very peculiar talent that could indeed change her as the butterflies were changed: she was a liar.</p>

<p class="story-teaser">The Monstruwacan entered the Watch compound in his own good time, the shadow of his accumulated fame falling before him. "So say, he was one of us, so say none can read his mind, so say he was Out before, so say he slew monsters — and men..."</p>

<p class="story-teaser">"Can you hear the voices, Monstruwacan?" Vyrkin asked. His voice jarred and the interruption was simultaneously a release and an insult.</p>
