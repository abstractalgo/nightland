			<title>AWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND by John C Wright</title>

<p class="story-teaser">I expected a whole series of tales from John set in his version of The Night Land, but his next story was a radical departure from anything that he or any of the rest of us had ever done. It surpassed not only Hodgson's talents but, damn it, Lovecraft's. When I read "Awake in the Night" I felt some envy, but when the ms for "The Last of All Suns" crossed my inbox I felt something like awe.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Hodgson's work is mostly or entirely in the public domain in many countries, and there are numerous editions, both electronic and printed.</p>
<h4>Of Note</h4>
<p>The Night Shade Books five-volume set <span class="book-title">The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson</span> is gorgeous. The bound books are out of print, and expensive, but electronic editions are available.</p>
<h4><span class="book-title">William Hope Hodgson's Night Lands</span> — edited by Andy Robertson</h4>
<p class="book-entry"><img class="float-left" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/nightlands-vol1-cover-thumb.jpg" alt="Cover for Night Lands Volume 1, showing a huge, bizarre monster in darkness." /></p>
<h5>Night Lands Volume 1: Eternal Love</h5>
<p class="book-entry">This is the first volume of stories from the Night Land Website. It's published by Betancourt &amp; Company (Wildside Press). It contains some stories no longer complete on the site.</p>
<p>Contents:</p>
<ul class="book-list">
<li>"Dream," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"The Siege of Humanity," by Sean McLachlan</li>
<li>"Black Irises," by Lucy A.E. Ward</li>
<li>"An Exhalation of Butterflies," by Nigel Atkinson</li>
<li>"Imago," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li>"Catharsis," by Nigel Brown</li>
<li>"The Testamont of Andros," by James Stoddard</li>
<li><span class="book-title">A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt,</span> by Nigel Atkinson</li>
<li>"Seeking Survival," by Erin Donahoe</li>
<li>"Awake in the Night," by John C. Wright</li>
<li>"Meanwhile, She Dreams," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li>"Out," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"Eater," by Andy Robertson</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="float-left" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/nightlands-vol2-cover-thumb.jpg" alt="Cover for Night Lands Volume 2, showing a flaming green sun." /></p>
<h5>Night Lands Volume II: Nightmares of the Fall</h5>
<p class="book-entry">This is the second volume of stories from the Night Land Website. It's published by the Utter Tower imprint of Three-Legged Fox. It also contains some stories no longer complete on the site.</p>
<p>Contents:</p>
<ul class="book-list">
<li>"The Cry of the Night Hound," by John C. Wright</li>
<li>"Jewel," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"Slope," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"Marks," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"The Voice of the Lacuna (A Play)," by Gerard Houarner</li>
<li>"Minotaur," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li>"Little Watcher," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li>"Eikon," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li><span class="book-title">The Last of All Suns,</span> by John C.Wright</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unnoted Abridgements</h4>
<p>I have been informed that the following editions of <span class="book-title">The Night Land</span> are abridged, but the abridgement is not noted in the book descriptions online, or on the covers:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="book-title">The Night Land: A Love Tale (The Radium Age Science Fiction Series)</span> published by HiLoBooks. Apparently Mr. Hodgson's original ending has been omitted — which dramatically changes the work (not, in my opinion, for the better).</li>
<li><span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> Volumes I and II, published by Pan/Ballantine, with an introduction by Lin Carter.</li>

			<title>I Return, and So Shall a Novella</title>
			<link>https://nightland.website/index.php/journal/29-this-site/292-i-return-and-so-shall-a-novella</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://nightland.website/index.php/journal/29-this-site/292-i-return-and-so-shall-a-novella</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago Nigel Atkinson's Night Land novella <em>A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt</em> was complete on the original version of this site; but our original editor, the late Andy Robertson, took the complete story down and left a teaser up, for the publication of <em>Night Lands Volume I: Eternal Love.</em> The <em>Night Lands</em> printed books (there was also a <em>Night Lands Volume II: Nightmares of the Fall)</em> were print-on-demand, and never cheap. Now, since the publisher of <em>Night Lands Volume II</em>, Paul Brazier of Three Legged Fox, has also died, the second volume is sometimes unavailable altogether.</p>
<p>I've decided to bring <em>A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt</em> back here to the website in its entirety. (Mr. Atkinson, if you should stumble across this, I don't have your email address.) I'm working on it presently.</p>
<p>I have a few other existing works to bring back, and I'm going to get to work on them. I want the website stories to be complete (except for <a href="http://www.scifiwright.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John C. Wright</a>'s stories, which he has republished in his ebook <a href="http://www.castaliahouse.com/awake-in-the-night-lands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awake in the Night Land</a>).</p>
<p>The Internet Archive has taken to archiving this site on the Wayback machine, but so far I haven't been able to turn it up on the Wayback search without giving the domain name 'nightland.website', unfortunately. There <em>is</em> a copy of Andy's version of the site (the domain was nightland.co.uk) from 2007.</p>
<p>I liked, and still like, the look of the old version. The only reason I switched is it's all HTML. I spent some time maintaining that version before Andy died, and the site had gotten big enough to be a formidable amount of work, and had a fair amount of cruft because it needed that much work. So I moved to a Content Management System. But finding the old one somewhere besides my hard drive brings back good memories.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="story-teaser">Immortality, Reincarnation, and Psychic Predation within a Science-Fictional Framework in Hodgson's Fiction</h3>
<h3 class="story-teaser">By <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a></h3>
<div class="story-intro"><a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/172-sharks-of-the-ether"><img class="story-thumb" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/strang-joshua-usaf-aurora-public-domain-thumb.jpg" alt="A blue-green-aurora swirling over a snowy landscape" /></a>
<p class="article-teaser">Hodgson's work assumes humans have an immortal, immaterial component which is constantly reincarnated in successive bodies, and is potentially the prey of larger and more powerful entities. I will argue that Hodgson has carefully worked this out within a consistent and rational science-fictional framework which merely borrows the background colouration of religious or occult superstition: and that in making this confusion, Hodgson was attempting a poetic reconciliation of scientific and religious views of the human condition.</p>
