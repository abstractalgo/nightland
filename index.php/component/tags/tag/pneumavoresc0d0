			<title>Grey Dog Tales Celebrates William Hope Hodgson</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://nightland.website/index.php/journal/30-news/223-grey-dog-tales-celebrates-william-hope-hodgson</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/" target="_blank">Grey Dog Tales </a>is hosting a month-long celebration of William Hope Hodgson. (Since I was bringing the site up, I'm a little late with this notification.)</p>
<p>William Hope Hodgson is often praised for his fantastic vision. He's not often praised for his characterization. Yet John Linwood Grant, in a post entitled "The Writer on the Borderland 1: Hodgson and Carnacki", points out that Mr. Hodgson's characterization of his occult detective Thomas Carnacki shows some humanizing characteristics not so clearly depicted in other writers' counterparts.</p>
<p>I note that the same effect takes place in <span class="book-title">The Night Land.</span> Mr. Hodgson often depicted protagonists who were desperately afraid of the weird threats they confronted: I believe a courageous character showing fear to be part of his technique for making his Outer Monstrosities fearful. X, the unnamed hero of <span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> is a brave, determined man and an accomplished fighter; and he regards certain of the Night Land's creatures with utter dread.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant is the author of <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/byseries/21841" target="_blank">Tales of the Last Edwardian</a>, a series of ghost or horror tales. They are available for free from Smashwords.</p>
<p>In the second half of the post Tim Prasil discusses how an anti-supernatural canon historically came to inform the literary concept of the mystery story.</p>
<p>Mr. Prasil is the author of the Vera Van Slyke occult detective stories.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="story-teaser">Immortality, Reincarnation, and Psychic Predation within a Science-Fictional Framework in Hodgson's Fiction</h3>
<h3 class="story-teaser">By <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a></h3>
<div class="story-intro"><a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/172-sharks-of-the-ether"><img class="story-thumb" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/strang-joshua-usaf-aurora-public-domain-thumb.jpg" alt="A blue-green-aurora swirling over a snowy landscape" /></a>
<p class="article-teaser">Hodgson's work assumes humans have an immortal, immaterial component which is constantly reincarnated in successive bodies, and is potentially the prey of larger and more powerful entities. I will argue that Hodgson has carefully worked this out within a consistent and rational science-fictional framework which merely borrows the background colouration of religious or occult superstition: and that in making this confusion, Hodgson was attempting a poetic reconciliation of scientific and religious views of the human condition.</p>
