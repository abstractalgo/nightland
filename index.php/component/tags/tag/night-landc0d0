			<title>A Timeline for Hodgsonian Fiction</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://nightland.website/index.php/background/timeline/184-timeline</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a possible timeline for William Hope Hodgson's weird fiction, and for stories published on this site. Note that none of it is carved in stone — not all stories on the site agree with each other. They may not agree with this timeline. Also, please note that the story positions on the timeline are only approximate.</p>
<p>Please note further that Mr. Hodgson never wrote anything about space travel in any of his speculative fiction. Some stories on this site assume that Man achieved interstellar flight, encountered Great Monsters in space, and was eventually driven back to Earth. But stories in which Man never left the Solar System could also fit Mr. Hodgson's milieu.</p>
<p><span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> <span class="book-title">The House on the Borderland,</span> the Carnacki stories, and the sea horror stories share a cosmology, even though they don't all belong to the same genres.</p>
<p>We also have <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/stories/night-land-stories/chronological-list-of-stories">a chronological list of stories</a> that are, or were, published on this site.</p>

<div class="tl-millions-row"><span class="tl-date">3 million A.D.</span><span class="tl-stories"> </span> <span class="tl-desc">The Sun has cooled to gold and the Earth's rotation has been markedly slowed by tidal drag. Owing to the oblateness of the Earth, equatorial sea-floor is — very slowly — becoming dry, and lands near the poles are being inundated, with equal want of speed. The greatest of all building projects — the World Road system — is begun.</span></div>

A vast procession of Moving Cities traverses the World Roads. The Earth has a band of dry land around its equator; the poles and the higher-latitude zones are drowned forever. Tribes of walkers accompany the Moving Cities.In higher latitudes, likewise, there are people following the Slow Sun in vast ships or fleets of boats.</span></div>

The people known as the Road-Makers begin a long, slow descent into the Valley. Over countless generations, they slowly descend and adapt, building the Road from which they get their name. Some make dwellings along the cliffs; others remain with the very few Moving Cities to surve the Cataclysm, as they travel the Road. A small number of surviving Moving Cities will reach the Valley floor.</span></div>

<p>What if you could be a divinity?</p>
<p>What if it cost you everything?</p>
<p>What if you faced monsters more terrible than you could imagine?</p>
<p>What if those monsters might be your salvation?</p>
<p>The sun has died...<br /> Not a planet, not a star shines n the black heavens above The Night Land.</p>
<p>In its midst The Last Redoubt, a vast, pyramid-shaped arcology, stands obdurate against the night, while within it the remnant millions of humanity live and thrive. The Days of Light are less than a legend to them, mouldered to dust amidst the chaos of ancient libraries.</p>
<p>Outside, strange immense and malevolent entities watch — and wait.</p>
<p>The Last Redoubt has stood ten million years and may stand ten million years more - but its final fall is inevitable. The last age is drawing to its close and the end of everything comes ever nearer.</p>
<p>The people of the Last Redoubt face this fate with stoicism, hedonism, heroic folly... except for two secretive orders who are making plans for survival and have found their champions, a man and a woman who will together carry the essence of humanity beyond the end of night.</p>
<p>But can they preserve their own humanity as well?</p>

			<title>Grey Dog Tales Celebrates William Hope Hodgson</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/" target="_blank">Grey Dog Tales </a>is hosting a month-long celebration of William Hope Hodgson. (Since I was bringing the site up, I'm a little late with this notification.)</p>
<p>William Hope Hodgson is often praised for his fantastic vision. He's not often praised for his characterization. Yet John Linwood Grant, in a post entitled "The Writer on the Borderland 1: Hodgson and Carnacki", points out that Mr. Hodgson's characterization of his occult detective Thomas Carnacki shows some humanizing characteristics not so clearly depicted in other writers' counterparts.</p>
<p>I note that the same effect takes place in <span class="book-title">The Night Land.</span> Mr. Hodgson often depicted protagonists who were desperately afraid of the weird threats they confronted: I believe a courageous character showing fear to be part of his technique for making his Outer Monstrosities fearful. X, the unnamed hero of <span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> is a brave, determined man and an accomplished fighter; and he regards certain of the Night Land's creatures with utter dread.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant is the author of <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/byseries/21841" target="_blank">Tales of the Last Edwardian</a>, a series of ghost or horror tales. They are available for free from Smashwords.</p>
<p>In the second half of the post Tim Prasil discusses how an anti-supernatural canon historically came to inform the literary concept of the mystery story.</p>
<p>Mr. Prasil is the author of the Vera Van Slyke occult detective stories.</p>]]></description>

<p>I first became aware of William Hope Hodgson's world after hearing positive buzz about <a href="http://www.castaliahouse.com/downloads/awake-in-the-night-land/" target="_blank"><span class="book-title">Awake in the Night Land</span></a> by <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/117-john-c-wright">John C. Wright</a>. A few minutes into John C. Wright's first story, I was already in love with the world without ever having read Hodgson's book. I know of nothing like <span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> no other works of fantasy have conveyed to me a sense of vastness, mystery, darkness, love, and hope quite like it. As an illustrator, I've found ample inspiration from the otherworldly and vague nature of the Night Land, and from the more tangible, but equally mysterious Redoubt. My goal is to capture those feelings as best as I can. I also want to be respectful of Hodgson's descriptions of his world, so that viewers get a more or less accurate picture of the Night Land without any careless inaccuracy so jarring to those that love the work. Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy my depictions of The Night Land.</p>]]></description>

Mr. Teng made it for the late <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson" target="_blank">Andy Robertson,</a> when the site was still at thenightland.co.uk.</p>
<hr class="section-break" />
<h4>Stephan Probst</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB0lakgwX_I" target="_blank"><img class="multimedia-thumb" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/probst-the-quieting-thumb.jpg" alt="A dark city revealed by shimmering yellow-orange window lamps." /></a></p>
<h5><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB0lakgwX_I" target="_blank">"The Quieting"</a> Music Video</h5>
<p>This work was inspired by Hodgson's vision of the Quiet City. Of it, Mr. Probst said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Quieting is based on the following three things: First is media artist Matthias Fritsch's sixth <span class="movie-title">Music from the Masses</span> film, called <span class="movie-title">Wintersong,</span> for which this piece of music is one of the soundtracks.</p>
<p>Second are the following two paragraphs from the book:</p>
<p>"And beyond the Watching Thing was The Place Where The Silent Ones Are Never, close by the great road; which was bounded upon the far side by The Giant's Sea; and upon the far side of that, was a Road which was always named The Road By The Quiet City; for it passed along that place where burned forever the constant and never-moving lights of a strange city; but no glass had ever shown life there; neither had any light ever ceased to burn.</p>
<p>"And beyond that again was the Black Mist. And here, let me say, that the Valley of The Hounds ended towards the Lights of the Quiet City."</p>
<p>Third is something I imagined. The Black Mist secretly invaded the city and sucked up, absorbed, ate (?) the inhabitants' voices, and with it their language, robbing them of the ability to form and share coherent thoughts. All that was left after the attack were dumb, soulless madmen who didn't even have the capacity left to fathom what had happened. The city turned quiet. Maybe what was left of the citizens became food for the Hounds.</p>
<p>Alternatively, here the story could tie in with what is mentioned in "Cry of the Night Hound" by <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/117-john-c-wright">John C. Wright</a>: the madness which resulted from the nature of the attack, because it couldn't establish itself in the formless chaotic minds, affected the brain stem itself and brought about mutations that made those lost humans mate with Night creatures and so contribute to the line of abhumans.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="story-teaser">Immortality, Reincarnation, and Psychic Predation within a Science-Fictional Framework in Hodgson's Fiction</h3>
<h3 class="story-teaser">By <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a></h3>
<div class="story-intro"><a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/172-sharks-of-the-ether"><img class="story-thumb" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/strang-joshua-usaf-aurora-public-domain-thumb.jpg" alt="A blue-green-aurora swirling over a snowy landscape" /></a>
<p class="article-teaser">Hodgson's work assumes humans have an immortal, immaterial component which is constantly reincarnated in successive bodies, and is potentially the prey of larger and more powerful entities. I will argue that Hodgson has carefully worked this out within a consistent and rational science-fictional framework which merely borrows the background colouration of religious or occult superstition: and that in making this confusion, Hodgson was attempting a poetic reconciliation of scientific and religious views of the human condition.</p>
