<p class="article-teaser">The Night Land is typically assumed to be either a work of fantasy, or one of horror. I will argue that it is Science Fiction.</p>

<h3 class="story-teaser">By <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a></h3>

<p><img class="story-thumb" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/awake-in-the-night-land-cover-thumb.jpg" alt="cover of Awake in the Night Land, showing a tall pyramid in darkness lit at the top." /></p>
<p class="story-teaser">I expected a whole series of tales from John set in his version of The Night Land, but his next story was a radical departure from anything that he or any of the rest of us had ever done. It surpassed not only Hodgson's talents but, damn it, Lovecraft's. When I read "Awake in the Night" I felt some envy, but when the ms for "The Last of All Suns" crossed my inbox I felt something like awe.</p>

<p class="story-teaser">Hodgson died in the trenches in 1918. This extract from one of his last letters, written early in 1918, is provided by Philip Ellis, and was part of an obituary in a magazine unknown to us:<br />"What a scene of desolation, the heaved-up mud rimming ten thousand shell craters as far as the sight could reach..."</p>

			<title>Grey Dog Tales Celebrates William Hope Hodgson</title>
			<link>https://nightland.website/index.php/journal/30-news/223-grey-dog-tales-celebrates-william-hope-hodgson</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://nightland.website/index.php/journal/30-news/223-grey-dog-tales-celebrates-william-hope-hodgson</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/" target="_blank">Grey Dog Tales </a>is hosting a month-long celebration of William Hope Hodgson. (Since I was bringing the site up, I'm a little late with this notification.)</p>
<p>William Hope Hodgson is often praised for his fantastic vision. He's not often praised for his characterization. Yet John Linwood Grant, in a post entitled "The Writer on the Borderland 1: Hodgson and Carnacki", points out that Mr. Hodgson's characterization of his occult detective Thomas Carnacki shows some humanizing characteristics not so clearly depicted in other writers' counterparts.</p>
<p>I note that the same effect takes place in <span class="book-title">The Night Land.</span> Mr. Hodgson often depicted protagonists who were desperately afraid of the weird threats they confronted: I believe a courageous character showing fear to be part of his technique for making his Outer Monstrosities fearful. X, the unnamed hero of <span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> is a brave, determined man and an accomplished fighter; and he regards certain of the Night Land's creatures with utter dread.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant is the author of <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/byseries/21841" target="_blank">Tales of the Last Edwardian</a>, a series of ghost or horror tales. They are available for free from Smashwords.</p>
<p>In the second half of the post Tim Prasil discusses how an anti-supernatural canon historically came to inform the literary concept of the mystery story.</p>
<p>Mr. Prasil is the author of the Vera Van Slyke occult detective stories.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>John Linwood Grant of Grey Dog Tales has finished up a month-long celebration of William Hope Hodgson with several posts of interest.</p>
<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=452" target="_blank">The Writer on the Borderland 9: An Editor Calls</a> has, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A link to Alfred Hitchcock's production of Mr. Hodgson's sea horror story "A Voice in the Night";</li>
<li>Links and reproduced critical material;</li>
<li>A reprint of James Bojaciuk's essay "A Concluding Oink", from <span class="magazine-title">Sargasso: The Journal of William Hope Hodgson Studies</span> No. 2, discussing the Hog (from <a href="http://www.forgottenfutures.com/game/ff4/hog.htm" target="_blank">the Carnacki story</a>) and the swine-things from <span class="book-title">The House on the Borderland.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=480" target="_blank">The Writer on the Borderland 10: He's Alive, Jim</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Strange Case of the Books in the Night", an essay by <a href="http://williamhopehodgson.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Sam Gafford</a> explaining how H. C. Koenig's efforts prevented Mr. Hodgson's work from being forgotten. (Mr. Koenig is <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/198-h-p-lovecraft-letters-mentioning-william-hope-hodgson" target="_blank">mentioned in H. P. Lovecraft's letters</a> for loaning Mr. Hodgson's books.)</li>
<li>Another essay by Mr. Bojaciuk discussing the identity of Thomas Carnacki's father.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=500" target="_blank">William Hope Hodgson 11: Critical Voices</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An interesting interview with Sam Gafford</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=511" target="_blank">The Writer on the Borderland 12: All Hallows' Exhaustion</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A link to three Carnacki audiobooks narrated by David Ian Davies and published by Blackstone Audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blackstone Audio has <a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalogsearch/advanced/byAuthor/author/William+Hope+Hodgson/?bioid=16407" target="_blank">another Carnacki story and <span class="book-title">The Night Land</span> too</a>, for surprisingly affordable prices.</p>
<p>Grey Dog Tales also has <a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?page_id=204" target="_blank">a gallery of cover art for Mr. Hodgson's works</a>, and in many cases, his photos are of less-beat-up books than ours are.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Mr. Grant's longdog posts are frequently hilarious.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Hodgson's work is mostly or entirely in the public domain in many countries, and there are numerous editions, both electronic and printed.</p>
<h4>Of Note</h4>
<p>The Night Shade Books five-volume set <span class="book-title">The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson</span> is gorgeous. The bound books are out of print, and expensive, but electronic editions are available.</p>
<h4><span class="book-title">William Hope Hodgson's Night Lands</span> — edited by Andy Robertson</h4>
<p class="book-entry"><img class="float-left" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/nightlands-vol1-cover-thumb.jpg" alt="Cover for Night Lands Volume 1, showing a huge, bizarre monster in darkness." /></p>
<h5>Night Lands Volume 1: Eternal Love</h5>
<p class="book-entry">This is the first volume of stories from the Night Land Website. It's published by Betancourt &amp; Company (Wildside Press). It contains some stories no longer complete on the site.</p>
<p>Contents:</p>
<ul class="book-list">
<li>"Dream," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"The Siege of Humanity," by Sean McLachlan</li>
<li>"Black Irises," by Lucy A.E. Ward</li>
<li>"An Exhalation of Butterflies," by Nigel Atkinson</li>
<li>"Imago," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li>"Catharsis," by Nigel Brown</li>
<li>"The Testamont of Andros," by James Stoddard</li>
<li><span class="book-title">A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt,</span> by Nigel Atkinson</li>
<li>"Seeking Survival," by Erin Donahoe</li>
<li>"Awake in the Night," by John C. Wright</li>
<li>"Meanwhile, She Dreams," by Brett Davidson</li>

<h5>Night Lands Volume II: Nightmares of the Fall</h5>
<p class="book-entry">This is the second volume of stories from the Night Land Website. It's published by the Utter Tower imprint of Three-Legged Fox. It also contains some stories no longer complete on the site.</p>
<p>Contents:</p>
<ul class="book-list">
<li>"The Cry of the Night Hound," by John C. Wright</li>
<li>"Jewel," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"Slope," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"Marks," by Andy Robertson</li>
<li>"The Voice of the Lacuna (A Play)," by Gerard Houarner</li>
<li>"Minotaur," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li>"Little Watcher," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li>"Eikon," by Brett Davidson</li>
<li><span class="book-title">The Last of All Suns,</span> by John C.Wright</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unnoted Abridgements</h4>
<p>I have been informed that the following editions of <span class="book-title">The Night Land</span> are abridged, but the abridgement is not noted in the book descriptions online, or on the covers:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="book-title">The Night Land: A Love Tale (The Radium Age Science Fiction Series)</span> published by HiLoBooks. Apparently Mr. Hodgson's original ending has been omitted — which dramatically changes the work (not, in my opinion, for the better).</li>
<li><span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> Volumes I and II, published by Pan/Ballantine, with an introduction by Lin Carter.</li>

<p>Back in 1988/9, having read — I now forget where — not only that William Hope Hodgson had lived for some time in Blackburn, Lancashire, but, of particular interest, that his idea for the mysterious dwelling of 'The House on the Borderland' may well have been influenced by his Blackburn home, I made attempts to find out where that home had been...</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="story-teaser">Immortality, Reincarnation, and Psychic Predation within a Science-Fictional Framework in Hodgson's Fiction</h3>
<h3 class="story-teaser">By <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a></h3>
<div class="story-intro"><a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/172-sharks-of-the-ether"><img class="story-thumb" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/strang-joshua-usaf-aurora-public-domain-thumb.jpg" alt="A blue-green-aurora swirling over a snowy landscape" /></a>
<p class="article-teaser">Hodgson's work assumes humans have an immortal, immaterial component which is constantly reincarnated in successive bodies, and is potentially the prey of larger and more powerful entities. I will argue that Hodgson has carefully worked this out within a consistent and rational science-fictional framework which merely borrows the background colouration of religious or occult superstition: and that in making this confusion, Hodgson was attempting a poetic reconciliation of scientific and religious views of the human condition.</p>
