<p class="article-teaser">The Night Land is typically assumed to be either a work of fantasy, or one of horror. I will argue that it is Science Fiction.</p>

<p class="story-teaser">Kore has again dreamed of the oiled flower, she tells Pallin, narrating it for him as if it is happening at the very time that she speaks. Her eyes are wide and frightened in the pale oval of her face, not at all as reassuring as they were in his own dream...</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="story-teaser">Immortality, Reincarnation, and Psychic Predation within a Science-Fictional Framework in Hodgson's Fiction</h3>
<h3 class="story-teaser">By <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a></h3>
<div class="story-intro"><a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/172-sharks-of-the-ether"><img class="story-thumb" src="https://nightland.website/images/thumbs/strang-joshua-usaf-aurora-public-domain-thumb.jpg" alt="A blue-green-aurora swirling over a snowy landscape" /></a>
<p class="article-teaser">Hodgson's work assumes humans have an immortal, immaterial component which is constantly reincarnated in successive bodies, and is potentially the prey of larger and more powerful entities. I will argue that Hodgson has carefully worked this out within a consistent and rational science-fictional framework which merely borrows the background colouration of religious or occult superstition: and that in making this confusion, Hodgson was attempting a poetic reconciliation of scientific and religious views of the human condition.</p>
