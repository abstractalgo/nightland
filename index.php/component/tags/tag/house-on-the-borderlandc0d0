			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a possible timeline for William Hope Hodgson's weird fiction, and for stories published on this site. Note that none of it is carved in stone — not all stories on the site agree with each other. They may not agree with this timeline. Also, please note that the story positions on the timeline are only approximate.</p>
<p>Please note further that Mr. Hodgson never wrote anything about space travel in any of his speculative fiction. Some stories on this site assume that Man achieved interstellar flight, encountered Great Monsters in space, and was eventually driven back to Earth. But stories in which Man never left the Solar System could also fit Mr. Hodgson's milieu.</p>
<p><span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> <span class="book-title">The House on the Borderland,</span> the Carnacki stories, and the sea horror stories share a cosmology, even though they don't all belong to the same genres.</p>
<p>We also have <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/stories/night-land-stories/chronological-list-of-stories">a chronological list of stories</a> that are, or were, published on this site.</p>

<div class="tl-millions-row"><span class="tl-date">3 million A.D.</span><span class="tl-stories"> </span> <span class="tl-desc">The Sun has cooled to gold and the Earth's rotation has been markedly slowed by tidal drag. Owing to the oblateness of the Earth, equatorial sea-floor is — very slowly — becoming dry, and lands near the poles are being inundated, with equal want of speed. The greatest of all building projects — the World Road system — is begun.</span></div>
<div class="tl-millions-row"><span class="tl-date">4 million A.D.</span><span class="tl-stories"><a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/stories/night-land-stories/the-days-of-darkening/11-narcissus">Narcissus</a> (begins)</span><span class="tl-desc">Many have dug in underground to escape the extremes of temperature, now that Earth's days and night are greatly lengthened. Some mobile arcologies have been built. The first World Road is complete near the Earth's equator.</span></div>

<div class="tl-millions-row"><span class="tl-date">6 million A.D.</span><span class="tl-stories"> </span><span class="tl-desc">Earth's day has lengthened to months. High latitudes are inundated by the oceans; the former ocean floor in low latitudes is dry. Cities move round the world on fixed roads, staying in the light. The World-Road has been greatly expanded.</span></div>

A vast procession of Moving Cities traverses the World Roads. The Earth has a band of dry land around its equator; the poles and the higher-latitude zones are drowned forever. Tribes of walkers accompany the Moving Cities.In higher latitudes, likewise, there are people following the Slow Sun in vast ships or fleets of boats.</span></div>

An ocean falls into the rift and bursts into a super-Krakatoa. A great Valley is formed, comparable to the Valles Marineris on Mars. Massive die-off and volcanic winter.</span>

The people known as the Road-Makers begin a long, slow descent into the Valley. Over countless generations, they slowly descend and adapt, building the Road from which they get their name. Some make dwellings along the cliffs; others remain with the very few Moving Cities to surve the Cataclysm, as they travel the Road. A small number of surviving Moving Cities will reach the Valley floor.</span></div>
<div class="tl-millions-row"><span class="tl-date">9 million A.D.</span><span class="tl-stories"> </span><span class="tl-desc">The Sun begins to die. The upward Earth grows quiet, cold, and "not good to live upon". Humanity cannot survive without protective clothing anywhere.<br /><br />Humans take over the floor of the Valley, displacing the dominant species there. They build cities along the Valley to the Bight where it turns northward, and continue their colonisation northward into the Shadow: but are repelled by the inhabitants of the Shadow, who are intelligent, but not human.</span>
