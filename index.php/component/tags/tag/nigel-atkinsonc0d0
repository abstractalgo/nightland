			<title>AWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND by John C Wright</title>

<p class="story-teaser">I expected a whole series of tales from John set in his version of The Night Land, but his next story was a radical departure from anything that he or any of the rest of us had ever done. It surpassed not only Hodgson's talents but, damn it, Lovecraft's. When I read "Awake in the Night" I felt some envy, but when the ms for "The Last of All Suns" crossed my inbox I felt something like awe.</p>

			<title>I Return, and So Shall a Novella</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago Nigel Atkinson's Night Land novella <em>A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt</em> was complete on the original version of this site; but our original editor, the late Andy Robertson, took the complete story down and left a teaser up, for the publication of <em>Night Lands Volume I: Eternal Love.</em> The <em>Night Lands</em> printed books (there was also a <em>Night Lands Volume II: Nightmares of the Fall)</em> were print-on-demand, and never cheap. Now, since the publisher of <em>Night Lands Volume II</em>, Paul Brazier of Three Legged Fox, has also died, the second volume is sometimes unavailable altogether.</p>
<p>I've decided to bring <em>A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt</em> back here to the website in its entirety. (Mr. Atkinson, if you should stumble across this, I don't have your email address.) I'm working on it presently.</p>
<p>I have a few other existing works to bring back, and I'm going to get to work on them. I want the website stories to be complete (except for <a href="http://www.scifiwright.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John C. Wright</a>'s stories, which he has republished in his ebook <a href="http://www.castaliahouse.com/awake-in-the-night-lands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awake in the Night Land</a>).</p>
<p>The Internet Archive has taken to archiving this site on the Wayback machine, but so far I haven't been able to turn it up on the Wayback search without giving the domain name 'nightland.website', unfortunately. There <em>is</em> a copy of Andy's version of the site (the domain was nightland.co.uk) from 2007.</p>
<p>I liked, and still like, the look of the old version. The only reason I switched is it's all HTML. I spent some time maintaining that version before Andy died, and the site had gotten big enough to be a formidable amount of work, and had a fair amount of cruft because it needed that much work. So I moved to a Content Management System. But finding the old one somewhere besides my hard drive brings back good memories.</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>You can divide the world up based on what people have read. So, let us try that exercise with "The Night Land". The vast majority of people have never heard of the book, or WHH. A few people bought the book up during the Golden Age of pulp reprints (about 25 years ago). Most of them were not too impressed by WHH's literary skills (many ran screaming from the room midway through the first chapter). A few hardy souls persisted, and were rewarded to discover one of the most colourful and inventive fictional worlds ever created.</p>
<p>There is no denying that WHH technically a poor writer, but his marvelous inventions - "The Great Redoubt", "The Thing that Nods", "The Road Where the Silent Ones Walk" to name a few - render such deficiencies (to an extent) if not irrelevant, then at least acceptable.</p>
<p>After seeing your call for fiction, I took my yellowing Sphere edition off the bookshelf and read the first few chapters. I was struck by the brief description of the Underground Country. Five minutes later I had the story worked out. Colour me stunned. That sort of inspiration is unlikely to visit again any time soon — it had never called before!</p>]]></description>
