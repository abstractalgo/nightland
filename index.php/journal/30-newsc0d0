			<description><![CDATA[<p>Henrik Möller runs a weird fiction podcast usually Swedish; it's called Udda Ting. In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henrik-moeller-180995804/udda-ting-avsnitt-13-nightland-william-hope-hodgson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udda Ting Episode 13</a> he interviewed Sam Gafford, John Linwood Grant, Nick Owen, Katherine Ouimet, and Kolja Aasgier. The opening of the podcast is Swedish, but the interviews are in English. English starts at 4:09, for listeners who don't speak Swedish.</p>
<p>I was asked, but, alas, couldn't make it. </p>
<p>This is still 'olds' rather than news: I've got some other posts to make about Hodgsonian projects people told me about when I was buried with other problems.</p>

			<title>More Carnacki</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img class="float-left-blog-illo" src="https://nightland.website/images/journal-others-illos/corley-carnacki-intro-page-400x589.png" alt="Intro page of Carnacki, Recorder of Things Strange" /></p>
<p>M.S. Corley is working on a comic called <a href="http://thomascarnacki.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Carnacki, Recorder of Things Strange</a>. He's planning to release the first volume later this year. It looks quite good (obviously).</p>
<p>John Linwood Grant has <a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=2490" target="_blank">a new post on Carnacki at Grey Dog Tales</a> which gives a good list of the new Carnacki stories published; and he also discusses Thomas Carnacki as a character with more human weakness than one commonly finds in the occult detective genre.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If I posted very much about H.P. Lovecraft, I could easily drown the weaker William Hope Hodgson signal. Nevertheless, most fans of Mr. Hodgson are also interested in Mr. Lovecraft's work.</p>
<p>Considering the sort of discussion that used to take place on the Night Speech bulletin board, I think some of you will appreciate Fred Lubnow's <a href="https://lovecraftianscience.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Lovecraftian Science</a> blog, in which he frequently considers Mr. Lovecraft's works from a scientific point of view.</p>
<p>He has published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_15?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=journal+of+lovecraftian+science&amp;sprefix=undefined%2Caps%2C146" target="_blank">The Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 1</a> in paperback and ebook format, and is presently preparing Volume 2.</p>]]></description>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://nightland.website/index.php/journal/30-news/240-the-yellow-booke-carnacki</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.oldstyletales.com/" target="_blank">Oldstyle Tales Press</a> are publishing an annual anthology of horror, ghost stories and weird fiction called <span class="book-title"><a href="http://www.oldstyletales.com/#!the-yellow-booke---your-annual-journal/czkv" target="_blank">The Yellow Booke</a></span>. You can download the PDFs for free, or buy the books at Amazon. There are two volumes available, for 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>Volume II (the 2015 book) has a Carnacki story by Taral Wayne. I'm posting before I've had a chance to read it, but the opening looks promising and I'm looking forward to it.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>John Linwood Grant of Grey Dog Tales has finished up a month-long celebration of William Hope Hodgson with several posts of interest.</p>

<li>Links and reproduced critical material;</li>
<li>A reprint of James Bojaciuk's essay "A Concluding Oink", from <span class="magazine-title">Sargasso: The Journal of William Hope Hodgson Studies</span> No. 2, discussing the Hog (from <a href="http://www.forgottenfutures.com/game/ff4/hog.htm" target="_blank">the Carnacki story</a>) and the swine-things from <span class="book-title">The House on the Borderland.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=480" target="_blank">The Writer on the Borderland 10: He's Alive, Jim</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Strange Case of the Books in the Night", an essay by <a href="http://williamhopehodgson.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Sam Gafford</a> explaining how H. C. Koenig's efforts prevented Mr. Hodgson's work from being forgotten. (Mr. Koenig is <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/essays/198-h-p-lovecraft-letters-mentioning-william-hope-hodgson" target="_blank">mentioned in H. P. Lovecraft's letters</a> for loaning Mr. Hodgson's books.)</li>
<li>Another essay by Mr. Bojaciuk discussing the identity of Thomas Carnacki's father.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=500" target="_blank">William Hope Hodgson 11: Critical Voices</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An interesting interview with Sam Gafford</li>

<p>Grey Dog Tales also has <a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?page_id=204" target="_blank">a gallery of cover art for Mr. Hodgson's works</a>, and in many cases, his photos are of less-beat-up books than ours are.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Mr. Grant's longdog posts are frequently hilarious.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img class="float-left-blog-illo" src="https://nightland.website/images/journal-others-illos/awake-in-the-night-land-cover.jpg" alt="cover of Awake in the Night Land, showing the Last Redoubt" /><a href="http://greydogtales.com/blog/?p=436" target="_blank">Grey Dog Tales has an interview</a> with author <a href="http://www.scifiwright.com/" target="_blank">John C. Wright</a>, in which they discuss William Hope Hodgson's <span class="book-title">The Night Land</span> and <span class="book-title">The House on the Borderland,</span> and Mr. Wright's Night Land stories. If you're familiar with this site, you'll know those stories were originally published here by the late <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/107-andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a>. They've since been republished in a collection called <a href="http://www.castaliahouse.com/downloads/awake-in-the-night-land/" target="_blank">Awake in the Night Land</a>, published by <a href="http://www.castaliahouse.com/" target="_blank">Castalia House</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright's remarks are well worth the reading, as one might expect.</p>]]></description>
