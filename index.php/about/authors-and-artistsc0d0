<p>I first became aware of William Hope Hodgson's world after hearing positive buzz about <a href="http://www.castaliahouse.com/downloads/awake-in-the-night-land/" target="_blank"><span class="book-title">Awake in the Night Land</span></a> by <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/about/authors-and-artists/117-john-c-wright">John C. Wright</a>. A few minutes into John C. Wright's first story, I was already in love with the world without ever having read Hodgson's book. I know of nothing like <span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> no other works of fantasy have conveyed to me a sense of vastness, mystery, darkness, love, and hope quite like it. As an illustrator, I've found ample inspiration from the otherworldly and vague nature of the Night Land, and from the more tangible, but equally mysterious Redoubt. My goal is to capture those feelings as best as I can. I also want to be respectful of Hodgson's descriptions of his world, so that viewers get a more or less accurate picture of the Night Land without any careless inaccuracy so jarring to those that love the work. Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy my depictions of The Night Land.</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>My primary purpose in writing this was to set a view of the world that respected the "feel" of Hodgson's creation, yet allowed adventures into the unexplored areas nearby without making such forays a complete departure from the dark dystopic vision of the original author.</p>
<p>I would suggest by way of compromise that the essay represents the flawed insight of someone conjecturing how the world described might have come to pass, without benefit of Hodgson's mind-set or that of Victorian scientific thought. The world I attempted to "re-create" is relatively consistent with the "feel" and "intent" of The Night Land and at the same time considerate of Louis Alvarez' continental drift theory, modern knowledge of climatology and planetary geology, weather, etc. I did not wish to destroy the feeling of TRUE NIGHT, but in a world where both radiative (insolation) and convective (magmatic movement) sources of heat have all but disappeared, it was difficult to "warm" even the depths of the Great Valley with vulcanism alone, as was the case with a handful of other facts. As you pointed out in your essay entitled "Sharks of the Ether", Hodgson himself was not satisfied with pure fantasy but attempted to lay a veneer of "scientific-ness" (my word) on the drab, hopeless and utterly alien landscape of his imagination. This essay was my attempt at a similar venture, and because the science has changed since Hodgson's time, must needs differ from his.</p>

<p>How I fell in love with the Night Land—</p>
<p>It was along process, but it had to be. I am a Dutch writer and illustrator and the Night Land speaks to both of my talents. It is like a extremely beautiful girl who is also a great conversationalist.</p>
<p>I knew William Hope Hodgson at first only as a writer of horror. The translation of "The Voice in the Night" was one of the first ghost stories I ever read, closely followed by Carnacki the Ghostfinder.</p>
<p>It was so long ago that people didn't talk about horror but called such stories ghost-stories.</p>
<p>I must have been about ten then and I decided I wanted to be a writer, too, especially of such strong and eery stuff. With, of course, creeping fungi.</p>
<p>Well, that worked. I've had about twenty horror-novels published.</p>
<p>I also noticed Jones' very strange cover for <span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> with the pyramid besieged by a horde of monsters. The picture was quite effective: without reading a single word I got a strong impression of the Night Land. And I wanted to visit there.</p>
<p>The book itself was impossible to find: I only had Sam Moskovitch's description of the book. But even a few sentences were enough: the endless roads with the Silent Ones, the dark sky with the sun no more than a black cinder. But most of all, it was the wideness of the playing ground, all those millions of years, with whole civilizations no more than a footnote.</p>
<p>Later I read "Awake in the Night" and found it quite strange ('strange' is the highest compliment I can give). I liked it but I didn't want to join yet. Perhaps because the Redoubt seemed too dark and stable, too resigned?</p>
<p>Some months ago I made a picture which suddenly reminded me of another book of Hodgson's, <span class="book-title">The House on the Borderland.</span> Looking for a place to sell it I found the Night Land site. Andy liked the picture but the site was about the Night land, not W. H. Hodgson in general. But if I wanted to paint a picture of the Night Land?</p>
<p>Well, I did. I started with the Redoubt itself, with the thousand cities, each more wondrous than the next.</p>
<p>The House of Silence even crept into my dreams and when I woke, I had to paint it. Only in my versions all windows were dark, while the book tell that all were glowing, making the House a beacon in the night. Why?</p>
<p>Painting and writing are two sides of the same coin for me. While I wrote "Embrace the Night" I painted four more pictures.</p>
<p>I am closer to cyberpunk than the Victorians, so I chose a younger, much more barbaric Redoubt. A Redoubt that still remembers the Road Makers and dreams of ruling the Earth again.</p>
<p>I have always loved the night. The Night Land felt for me like an endless Saturday night, with the world impossible wide and full of wonders. The pulsing Kilns of the Giants and the dancing shadows are like neon on wet cobblestones, the howling of night-hounds the pulse of distant rock music. I wanted to embrace the night. Of course there are monsters: every young man who walks the dark street knows that, but that is part of the joy. It will not be safe and that is glorious.</p>
<p>Your true, eternal, lover is also an integral part of Hodgson's universe, most of all, because you'll meet her again and again and no life is complete without her.</p>
<p>But what if your true love was a soul-eating monster? How could you ever be worthy of her?</p>]]></description>

<p>Keith Sloan is a naval officer who has somehow managed to beach himself in Omaha, Nebraska. His fascination with Hodgson stems from a combination of a love for weird fiction, especially Lovecraft, and from Hodgson's own obsession with the sea. Though originally coming to Hodgson through his Sargasso Sea stories, he is still most haunted by the vision of the Night Land.</p>
<p>Keith writes when his duties allow, which means he never has enough time to do the writing he'd like. He has had a few other short stories published in a variety of fantasy magazines and even an anthology. His short historical fiction has appeared in <i>Tarpeian Rock.</i></p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>I discovered William Hope Hodgson's work via the splendidly lurid Sphere paperback reprints of the early 1980s. I became involved in the fantasy and supernatural small press around that time, and contributed an essay, "Against the Abyss: Carnacki the Ghost Finder", to Ian Bell's booklet William Hope Hodgson: Voyages and Visions (1987): later I also wrote on Carnacki in a column on "The Other Detectives" for Sherlock Holmes magazine (issue 24, 1998). Hodgson's psychic sleuth was one of the influences on my own aesthetical occult detective, The Connoisseur, whose first volume of adventures was published as IN VIOLET VEILS (Tartarus Press, 1999): I am slowly completing a second volume.</p>
<p>I've also also written a biography of Arthur Machen (Seren Books, 1995), am secretary of The Friends of Arthur Machen and have co-edited their journal, <i>Faunus.</i> With Roger Dobson, I publish <i>The Lost Club Journal,</i> devoted to obscure and neglected authors.</p>
<p>"The Inward Seer" was written in direct response to Andy Robertson's call for stories set in the Night Land and would not have been completed without some good creative editing by Andy. It is intended to raise the question of whether the Redoubt would fall from within before it succumbed to the forces outside, human societies being what they are. It also gave me the opportunity of revivifying another favourite occult detective, by bringing in to the story an avatar of the elegant and ennui-ridden Prince created by M.P. Shiel.</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>My first introduction to THE NIGHT LAND was in The Year's Best Science Fiction 21st collection, presenting stories from 2003. Therein was the story "Awake In The Night," by <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/authors-and-artists/117-john-c-wright">John C Wright</a>, which utterly captivated me as few stories — perhaps no other stories/story — has. I've read it many times, studying every word, scene, character, plot development, and completely entranced by the masterful mixing of time sequence. But long before this study, I went back and read the introduction by Gardner Dozois. In part: 'William Hope Hodgson's quirky Victorian masterpiece THE NIGHT LAND, one of the flat-out strangest novels ever written, has had a large — although often unmentioned — effect on science fiction and fantasy over the generations... Not all the writers...are up to...handling Hodgson's eerie, unearthly, somberly lyrical, and poetically charged milieu, but <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/authors-and-artists/117-john-c-wright">John C Wright</a>...handles the material as if he was born to do so...' And of course after reading that, I had to seek out the original Night Land.</p>
<p>I downloaded it from the internet, and immediately was captivated. I had read none of the apologia nor criticism, and with fresh eyes and an undimmed sense of utter wonder and thrill, I read. But soon I found myself both jarred out of the narrative dream by the prose style, and helplessly swept up in the story. So I started editing as I read. Just to make it more readable, I told myself. I have to show this to other people, and if I can just simplify this convoluted sentence so they won't have to work so hard, they will surely see the magnificence of the story. Oh, and yes, let me remove this whole paragraph of apology for the poor writing by the narrator himself! Really now, no need to bring that up. Yes, and why not a few gerunds. And so forth. It was a strange experience to hurtle through the story, absurdly eager to discover new wonders and terribly anxious to find out what happens to the hero and his love, while also editing as I went to clear the dust and reveal the pure core of the story. Yet this I did, rewriting as I read, typing while I clenched my teeth in dread, or shouted in triumph, or poured forth tears, or melted in relief.</p>
<p>And then I went back and read "Awake In The Night" again, and Yes! saw all the tropes of THE NIGHT LAND, not merely expertly woven in, but expanded and enhanced. And then I went back and reread that introduction, and saw this: 'Now, in a new century, (THE NIGHT LAND) has inspired a Web site and an anthology devoted to new stories written as homages to Hodgson by various hands, both edited by Andy W. Robertson.'</p>
<p>So I went to the Website. Overbubbling with delight and enthusiasm — the newbie way — I found the Forum and started posting comments. I quickly pretended to role-play, as a voice of the Powers for Good, enticing the people of the Redoubt to travel into the West, where salvation awaited beyond the green luminous mist (one of many intriguing possibilities mentioned in the original story). The Master Monstruwaccan was not to be fooled, however, and suspected a deceit from the Evil Powers. So I wrote and posted a poem on the Forum, Beyond the green luminous mist. Soon after, Andy purchased the poem for posting on the site, for $37 US — my first professional sale. And my first professional debate over the title, which I asserted must remain small case, as Hodgson had (inexplicably) done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was combing through the original novel again and again, refining my editing, applying consistent parameters to the text, finding better ways to restructure words, sentences, paragraphs, but not daring to change a single aspect of the basic story. I was reading the Forum, discovering the criticisms, the detractions, the supposed flaws. Yet I could not agree. Yes of course, the prose style was the main reason more people had not read the masterpiece, but the handling of gender and romance I defended as more noble, and more natural, than our own jaded ways. More unbelievable the way we post-moderns live and love, than the way the hero and his soul-mate do.</p>
<p>Again I combed through the novel, and again, refining, clarifying, seeking a perfect revealing of Hodgson's original intent in the most readable and accessible prose, without changing an iota of content, and preserving the original gothic style. And after all those passes, I felt I knew the Night Land so well that I could write a story set in that world, with enough references and faithfulness to the original to entertain perhaps the other visitors to the Website, or at least its editor, who I knew now was as helpless a fan as I. And I was bursting to express myself, whose imagination soared and pierced through the darkness to explore the many other marvels and mysteries but hinted at by the original author. Ever my sight was drawn back to that softly glowing green mist in the West, beyond which legend said some vague salvation lay.</p>
<p>Thus my first professional short story sale ensued, "Heaven Sent." There's much more to the story of how Andy and I worked over months to bring it to acceptance, through numerous personal and professional challenges on both sides, including another discussion of the title, which I now see he was right about.</p>
<p>Two of those chapters from my rewrite of the original, which I call <em>The New Night Land</em>, were later posted on the site. After hearing that another anthology was being planned, collecting stories from The Days of Darkening, I undertook to write a story from that part of the timeline, and "Eve of Evil" was born, nursed, sent out into the world, and accepted (again I wrangled with the editor over the title, and again he conceded, though I suspect I might deem him right once again in the near future).</p>
<p>My first story was an expression of all my enthusiasm and delight for the complex world of THE NIGHT LAND — and to "Awake in the Night." My second, while also genuinely exploring a portion of the historical timeline, was also self-therapeutic. Early childhood abandonment and abuse issues, and the desperate compulsion to please and seek the acceptance of others that can result, were woven into the plot. The Night Land does that: strips away the layers to reveal the core drama, the primal essence of human nature confronted with the great dark mystery. Love and death, the classic themes, are masterfully worked into the epic saga that has inspired my imagination and begun my writing career.</p>
<p>Worlds without end...Or more truly, a world truly ending, with endless possibilities within it. Now I'm polishing a sequel to my first story, developing the lives of the original characters and introducing some new ones. But the Night Land remains the same: threatening, mysterious, captivating, grim and enchanting.</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>I had never heard about THE NIGHT LAND or its author until I saw Andy Robertson passing around the book in the pub. Everybody was commenting about its vivid pictures and ideas way ahead of its time, and I felt curious about it. Even more curious when Andy said that he wanted authors to write stories set in that universe!</p>
<p>After reading it, I couldn't help but agree that it was a very interesting universe indeed. First, because even though the setting is markedly fantastic, its inhabitants try to explain it in a rational, rather than magical, way. Their explanations may sometimes look naive and more typical of the Dark Ages than of a truly technological era, but it's made clear that even the strangest unexplained events must have some kind of logical reason behind them. So it was a fascinating challenge to try to find some rationalizations for some of the most curious facts, that Hodgson never even tried to explain.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect is the idea of a humanity whose history spans over a period of millions of years, instead of a mere few thousands. Cosmic events that we usually consider too slow to be of any importance become then an integral part of human history. I liked the idea of writing a story that developed during such a long period of time that you had to take into account cosmic changes.</p>
<p>And I couldn't forget that the Night Land universe is one that takes to the limit the "Us or Them" scenario. All humanity is confined to a giant pyramid locked in itself, and the outside world is full of monsters of unknown intentions, but undoubtedly evil. I couldn't help wondering what would be the perspective from the other side.</p>
<p>Those were, basically, the ingredients I used to write "Children of the Hive."</p>]]></description>

<li>The Night Land Rewritten</li>
</ul>
<p>I was sixteen years old when I first encountered THE NIGHT LAND, in a new paperback edition published by Ballantine Books. I had already read a number of books from Ballantine's "Sign of the Unicorn" Fantasy series, which reprinted the best of the pre-Tolkien fantasy writers such as Lord Dunsany, William Morris, and Mervyn Peake. Despite Hodgson's archaic style and Victorian romanticism, I was fascinated by the story. About ten years ago, frustrated that so few people had even heard of the book, I got the idea to rewrite it, to try to make it more accessible to the average reader. Various commitments prevented me from doing so until this past year. It was one of the most difficult things I've attempted, since I had to add dialogue (Hodgson used none) and illuminate motives and characterization. Fortunately, it was a labor of love. By the time I finished, I had distilled Hodgson's 200,000 plus words down to about 105,000. The Night Land is science fiction, fantasy, and most of all, one of the great romances of all time. It should not be forgotten.</p>]]></description>

<p>In the life of every bookish person, there are a few favored books, read in the golden time of youth, that come to dwell in the imagination forever. The vividness of images, the strength of heroes, the beauty of heroines, the strangeness and wonder of the settings, are burned into the heart: every other tale read after is compared to these golden tales.</p>
<p>I had graduated college, and was past the age when the book of gold is found, and I was lamenting that I was, perhaps, too old and jaded to meet the wonders of youth again, when a friend recommended Hodgson’s THE NIGHT LAND to me. I had told him once of a fantasy I was writing, called Nigh-Forgotten Sun (the unfinished manuscript still exists), and my friend thought that I was consciously copying the theme of Hodgson’s story: he was amazed that I had never heard of the book, since it was exactly suited to my own writing, both in style and theme.</p>
<p>So I read volume one of the Ballantine edition edited by Lin Carter. I found the golden time of youthful wonder was not past. What visions I saw!</p>
<p>At the time, poor as a church mouse (or, I should say, rather, poor as a law student) I had no resources to find whether the second volume was still in print. In the days before the Internet, libraries and used bookstores did not maintain inventory lists where a poor student could find them.</p>
<p>And so this antique tale, when I had reached the point where the nameless narrator stands before the darkened ruins of the Lesser Redoubt, which he endured much toil, heart-ache, terror and incalculable dangers to reach, instead of finding his love, his spirit senses, somewhere hidden in the metal structure, dread and fell presences waiting to destroy him. His beloved, and all her people, her culture, her world, have been wiped out. At that cliffhanger I was left, and I did not know if any copy of the ending of the tale survived.</p>
<p>To me it seemed as if I had found an antique sea-chest in an attic, or washed ashore from the wrack of Atlantis, containing only one half of a manuscript, and that I had no hope of ever finding the finish of the tale.</p>
<p>How precious that dog-eared paperback was to me! In the opening paragraphs of the first chapter, the narrator is speaking casually to Mirdath the Beautiful, a maiden of the gentry of the English rural countryside. A more comfortable and bucolic setting cannot be imagined. Then, when he says, 'It is an elf night; the Towers of Sleep rise' she answers by speaking of the Moon-Garden, the City of Twilight, and the Tree with the Great Painted Head.</p>
<p>By that word she reveals that she is like him: a soul that is more than mortal, that has lived other lives in other cycles of reincarnation, dimly half-forgotten.</p>
<p>She and he are both travelers from moon-lit elfin lands or empires of cloudy nightmare, and they hail from places far beyond the little fields we know, older than human history: they have seen the light of other suns, other days. They dance to music we cannot hear. No one of their own time will understand them.</p>
<p>I cannot express how eerie this seemed to me, how pregnant with secret promise. What reader of fantastic fiction has not seemed, to himself at least, to be a changling like this, someone who is more at home in stranger worlds than the mundane one around us? As a man who is out of tune with his own time (surely, dear reader, that is seen in the way I express my thought to you) I found delight to think that there might be, for me, too, a Mirdath the Beautiful awaiting.</p>
<p>Few books can match the strange promise of those hints: THE NIGHT LAND overmatches it. In chapter two our narrator , mad with grief and loss, recovers memories from uncounted millions of years in the remotest future, long after the sun is dead, and he gazes from the embrasures of the Last Redoubt of Man upon the wonders and horrors of the Night Land: he sees the dim fires burning in the Giant’s Kilns; the single visible eye of the Southeastern Watcher shines from its hulking silhouette of its grim, huge head, unblinking; the Night-Hounds cry out, and the Silent Ones do not, and the doors of the House of Silence, in all eternity, have never closed.</p>
<p>Nothing I have ever read before or since contains such a mood of pure unearthliness. Wraiths and Dark Lords and devils from fantasy stories seem quaint and old-fashioned, and are more likely to invoke nostalgia rather than awe; aliens from science fiction stories share our laws of nature, and come from our universe. The inhuman presences and monsters of the Night Land, on the other hand, are cloaked in impenetrable mystery.</p>
<p>The stilted and archaic language, I find no fault with. Perhaps I am the only reader who does not. A language less formal and gravid might not serve to capture the dark, heavy, grim and gothic majesty of the piece. I know my friend Mr. <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/background/authors-and-artists/118-james-stoddard">Stoddard</a> has made a brave attempt in this direction, but, for my taste, more might be lost than gained by modernizing the tongue.</p>
<p>Finally, after many years of wondering and waiting, I found the second volume. An archeologist finding the lost dialogs of Aristotle, the eighth book of Apollonius, or the missing ending to the epic of Lucretius could not know greater triumph than I did.</p>
<p>Here I met Mirdath the Beautiful, reincarnated as Naani, a daughter of the Lesser Redoubt. Many other readers find fault with her: let them. She is precious to me. I can think of no other character possessing her quirks, her cleverness, her playful heedlessness, her unparalleled bravery. She is self-sacrificing without being a martyr, shows both spirit and fortitude that would break any lesser lass, she is braver than a man and yet still humble and demure.</p>
<p>If I sound like a man infatuated, let this be a testament to the skill of Hodgson’s writing. Keep your joyless Galadriel, your spiteful Titania, your lascivious Helen, your treacherous Guinevere and deadly Clytemnestra, your cunning Penelope, your absurd Xena: to match her for charm, perhaps you can hold up Nausicaa or Miranda as her equals; to match her for courage and endurance, who is there?</p>
<p>The love-story that C.S. Lewis so casually dismisses as a fatuous erotic interest, I thought was almost Promethean in its power. Here is a man who reaches across a billion years of time, and braves the unthinkable dangers of the Night, to save the woman who is his own true love, because he hears in his mind the whisper of her plea for help, as if in a dream. By the mysterious aetheric sympathy they share, from far-off, he hears her voice in the night, and he knows her. Based only on that whisper, and his hope, into the eternal darkness, like Orpheus, he goes. (The only other story that is even close in its scope and power is “At the Eschaton” by Charles Sheffield, appearing in the Far Futures anthology. With apologies to Sheffield, I found the short story more striking than the novel-version). Neither all the aeons of eternity, nor all the darkness and horror of the hopeless night, nor even death itself, can part the lovers.</p>
<p>The Victorianisms other readers find galling, I find as refreshing as an oasis in a wasteland of ash. The way sex is handled in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND or even LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS is the norm I was to meet, over and over again, unchanged, unchallenged, unquestioned, in every story I found in my childhood. The casual fornications of James Bond and Captain Kirk were presented as normal, their penismanship as praiseworthy. Self-control, chastity, romance, marriage, family, even though they are the most normal things in the world (I am tempted to say, the only normal things in the world) were dismissed by all modern writers as psychopathologies of the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Perhaps when Heinlein first wrote the idea of having a sloppy sex-life might seem boldly non-conformist, and shocking. Now it is the conformity, and the only way boldly to shock the new conformists is to suggest that some sort of self-discipline in the sexual appetites might be useful, wise and comely.</p>
<p>Self-control, temperance, prudence, and moderation are values much praised by ancient pagan philosophers, the iron-hearted Stoics of Greece and Rome. Odd as this sounds, the final theme that endears the Night Lands to me, is this very iron-heartedness: it is the kind of book a stoic might approve.</p>
<p>The universe is utterly hostile, utterly malevolent, incomprehensible, dark, brooding, malefic, and filled with dread. While there is reincarnation in this world, every indication in the text is that this is not a supernatural phenomenon, not a matter of religion, but of some yet-to-be-discovered science of etheric rays or spirit-vibrations.</p>
<p>In the Night Land, there are benevolent powers whose mysterious actions sometimes save a stranded wanderer. Hodgson might have added them to have something analogous to dolphins (which sailor’s tall tales say aid drowning men), to contrast with his soul-destroying monsters, who circle the last redoubt of man as sharks follow a ship laden with bullocks.</p>
<p>But these are entities whose true purposes are unknown, who neither seek nor are given worship, and who appear only about as frequently as reports of UFO’s or Abominable Snowmen appear among modern men. They are not Valkyries, waiting to draw fallen heroes up to feast in Valhalla; they are not Mercury, waiting to escort shades to Elysium; and they are not angels waiting to welcome the faithful to paradise. Ultimately, there is no comfort to be had from them. There is no comfort to be found anywhere in Hogdson’s black and agnostic universe: save in the arms of love itself.</p>
<p>And, since this is a fairy tale, we are told the love can endure even if the eons change, even if the sun goes out, even if the beloved seems to die.</p>
<p>Like the real universe, the terror-haunted universe of THE NIGHT LAND is both utterly hopeless, and utterly filled with hope: as inescapable as death itself, is love.</p>
<p>Years and years ago, I spent a dreamy summer inventing tales to set into Hodgson's background, imagining the culture, traditions, and lore, filling in bits of the history of the Last Redoubt, of the final race of man. I was certain that no one had ever read this book but me; I was sure such stories would never find a home. It seemed like providence, miraculous, that I came across Mr. Robertson’s call for stories set in this background in a trade journal, after I had so long ago dismissed all hope of such a thing.</p>
<p>While my humble work falls appallingly short of Hodgson’s genius, to honor the favorite story of one’s young life, by writing a story of one’s own, was a chance not often given to writers, for which my gratitude is endless. For honor him I ought: all the secret, youthful, golden places in my imagination are still touched by images and echoes from his work.</p>
<p>Still, I seem to behold the mighty Home of Man, surrounded by the sacred aura of its air-clog, windows and balconies ablaze, defying (though doomed to fall to them) the silent and motionless monstrosities crouching at its eaves; still the Silent Ones slide forward from the gray gloom, noiseless, draped in gauze.</p>
<p>In some place in my heart, the Masters of the Watch are always raising their weapons in salute to the brave and nameless traveler who stands at the valves of the gate leading out into the Night, with all lamps quenched, so that the horrors will not know a child of man creeps forth. Still the warm scent of the last kiss of Mirdath the Beautiful lingers on the bereaved lover's lips, though that kiss was kissed twenty-five million years ago; still he hears her voice across the nightland of a darkened world, calling.</p>]]></description>

<p>But, unlooked for, the story came. I imagined myself inside that Great Pyramid: How would it be? Could I gaze out from an embrasure over the Land, or would I shun it? Deny it?</p>]]></description>

<p>William Hope Hodgson’s writing reflects his dissatisfaction with the modern world that was emerging around him. When THE NIGHT LAND was published in 1912, the countryside he loved was giving way to teeming cities shrouded in coal smoke. Trains cut through the landscape, and people were becoming slaves to the very machines they had invented to make their lives easier. Hodgson looked at what his world was becoming and took it to its logical conclusion. He wrote of humans living in steel-encased artificial cities, hiding from a blasted and dead landscape.</p>
<p>In 1912 this was not yet a popular view of the future. Most people were still thrilled with the rapid pace of technological and industrial progress. It wasn’t until the First World War ravaged the cities of Europe, killing millions, that the world woke up to the dangers of mankind’s technological power. Hodgson himself saw the similarities of the Western Front and his vision. Because of this, THE NIGHT LAND can be seen as a prophetic novel, all the more so because the author perished in that war.</p>]]></description>

<p>I first discovered THE NIGHT LAND in high school and was immediately captivated by the vision of the book. At first it was the concept of a world so far distant from ours that the Sun was a half-forgotten myth, as well as the weirdness of the Land itself and all its monsters and bizarre phenomena.</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by evolution, fossils and paleontology, and the idea of a human society that really lived and thought in terms of geological time was extremely compelling.</p>
<p>However, once I saw that the Night Land site was accepting new work and started to think about what I might write, it was the entropic nature of the Watchers as representations of an implacable fate and of the Land itself as a world starved of all energy except the dwindling store of Earth-Current that came to the fore.</p>]]></description>

<p>The Night Land is as peculiar, inaccessible and as universal as a nightmare or a myth. The things and events of the Land, and the Land itself are compulsive and as such, have their own energy. To tap into this mythology is to find expression for something deeper than personal experience, and yet the elemental nature of everything that Hodgson has created also finds clear articulation in a very personal, intimate scale. It is this duality that I find so interesting about Hodgson, and this is what I believe makes his work genuinely mythical. It brings hidden forces to the surface and gives them form and it enables a connection with the depths of our own psychology.</p>
<p>The cosmic tragedy of the setting, the "Entropic Romance", makes the scenario especially poignant, the challenge being to find meaning, so to speak, directly under the point of the sword of Damocles.</p>
<p>There is so much too that seems genuinely prescient about Hodgson, as if he were tapping into the "zeitgeist": there are hints of Jungian psychology before Jung, Existentialism, the arcology concept and so on. Clearly also he has been directly influential on later writers, not least the New Wave writers such as Michael Moorcock, M. John Harrison and Brian Aldiss. There are also plenty of references, if not outright homage in the work of Brian Stableford and Stephen Baxter.</p>
<p>The Night Land is both inspiring and challenging and a great opportunity to drop names. What more could a new writer ask for?</p>]]></description>

<p>How many stories can be told in a narrative that spans billions of years to the End of Eternity? This is the power of The Night Land, the vast imaginings of a story where humanity clings to existence, moving forward into the depths of almost inconceivable time. It is such a tale of hope to think that humanity will be there, millions of years into the future. And perhaps, even there at the very End of Eternity.</p>
<p>The Night Land is populated by dark mystery, by fantasy. In the Night Land our internal fears, the worst of us, have been transformed into the monstrous abhuman, ourselves made malevolent. The Night Land is populated by the monsters of humanity's imagination, ancient fears made real into slow watching malevolent flesh. I wonder what forces are working on me, outside the scope of my understanding, less visible, more dangerous than the Watchers.</p>
<p>Time, which changes all things, has changed the people of the Night Land. What stories do they tell, these men and women altered incrementally along the slow generations and by the need to defy the forces of the Night Land which seek to consume and destroy them? In this time beliefs that have reoccurred through many civilisations have become manifest and accepted. The people of the Night Land may dream the past or future, remembering their past lives on the wheel of reincarnation. They might knowingly live their loves and despairs time and time again through the generations. In The Night Land the wealth of civilisations' experience is piled up in the Monstruwacans' libraries much like our own memories, misremembered, fragmented but treasured.</p>
<p>I think their stories can tell me what is essential about humanity. I think their stories can tell me what is might be enduring about humanity. I think their stories can speak to me right here, right now, in these Days of Light.</p>
<p>I think that the Night Land tales sung in the dim red light of a dying sun, sung on a world under a cold black night where the end of times is known and approaches inexorably; I think these songs can shine a light on my own understanding. Right here, right now.</p>

<p>You can divide the world up based on what people have read. So, let us try that exercise with "The Night Land". The vast majority of people have never heard of the book, or WHH. A few people bought the book up during the Golden Age of pulp reprints (about 25 years ago). Most of them were not too impressed by WHH's literary skills (many ran screaming from the room midway through the first chapter). A few hardy souls persisted, and were rewarded to discover one of the most colourful and inventive fictional worlds ever created.</p>
<p>There is no denying that WHH technically a poor writer, but his marvelous inventions - "The Great Redoubt", "The Thing that Nods", "The Road Where the Silent Ones Walk" to name a few - render such deficiencies (to an extent) if not irrelevant, then at least acceptable.</p>
<p>After seeing your call for fiction, I took my yellowing Sphere edition off the bookshelf and read the first few chapters. I was struck by the brief description of the Underground Country. Five minutes later I had the story worked out. Colour me stunned. That sort of inspiration is unlikely to visit again any time soon — it had never called before!</p>]]></description>

<p>One other writer told us of vast psychic predators which ate human souls. A link between Hodgson and Cordwainer Smith may seem silly, but it works surprisingly well.</p>
<p>"Eater" is my essay at diagramming the inner life of a Monstruwacan: and my first ever attempt at writing fiction.</p>
<p>The story also reflects to some extent my rejection of Hodgson's treatment of women. I wanted to write about a thoroughly honorable and brave woman, and a true daughter of the Redoubt.</p>
<p>"Out" was my attempt to address Hodgson's cosmic eroticism directly. Good or bad, it says everything I can about the subject. It reflects some of my own beliefs about love, and a little of my own life experience, much transformed. It also introduced Scyrr, who emerged of his own accord and insisted on becoming the centre of that story and much else.</p>
<p>"Kiss" and "Marks" are pendant to "Out". The first story is an account of the destruction of the Heresy of Scyrr, later much expanded by Brett in ANIMA. The second is an eyewitness account of the healing process that followed, from one of the common people. The other stories stand alone, and may be taken on their own terms. My own favorite is "Slope," which is on one level an account of the foredoomed attempt to colonize the Land of Seas and Volcanoes, but on a deeper level a meditation on how the journey across the Land s like human life, with its unremembered paradisaical beginning in the womb and its terrible end.</p>
<p>The other reason why I write about The Night Land is very simple. I had in very truth a beautiful wife, who died young. You may call her Lynette. I am an old man now but I still dream of her, and it is in her memory that I write these stories.</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>A native of Birmingham, Alabama (United States), THE WRECK OF THE AETHERWING is the first piece of fiction James will have had published.</p>
<p>“I have always wanted to write, yet hesitated to do so in light of my mind being inundated with a surfeit of Lovecraft and Tolkien. I didn’t want to write pastiches. This NIGHT LAND project allowed me to write in an established and structured milieu, yet one that was filled with sufficient mystery as well as unexplored eras and areas to allow one a relatively free hand.</p>
<p>I’ve been fascinated with Hodgson since I first read TNL as a teenager. I didn’t care about the laborious writing style, or the gross repetition of certain mundane events and statements: the sheer vistas of the benighted Earth caught me up, and have never wholly left me. I’m very pleased to offer this tale as a small homage to the legacy of THE NIGHT LAND.”</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>When I discovered <span class="book-title">The Night Land,</span> I was already working on an idea for a story about psychic predators, drawing heavily on the lore of the classic nightmare experience to create them. Hodgson's Silent Ones turned out to be similar enough to my predators that I became intrigued by the idea of writing a story that meshed the concepts.</p>
<p>One of the things that Hodgson does supremely well is to present the alien denizens of the Night Land as menacing. Yet in the days before the building of the Mighty Pyramid, some humans had dealings with the Outsiders. What could bring any sane person to consider the idea? “<a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/stories/night-land-stories/the-days-of-darkening/3-red-twilight">Red Twilight</a>” is my attempt to answer that question.</p>
<p>The Pioneer Dogs who appear briefly in “<a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/stories/night-land-stories/3-red-twilight">Red Twilight</a>” are the creation of <a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/31-authors-and-artists/39-nigel-price">Nigel Price</a>, and their story is revealed in his excellent “<a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/stories/night-land-stories/2-parting">Parting</a>.”</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<p>I first encountered William Hope Hodgson one Saturday in the summer of 1972. I was browsing through the science fiction and fantasy paperbacks in the back of the High Hill Bookshop in Hampstead in northwest London when I came across the newly published two-volume edition of THE NIGHT LAND edited by Lin Carter for the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. I was immediately smitten by the dark and monstrous covers, designed by Robert LoGrippo, and lured by the quotations from Clark Ashton Smith cited under the novel’s title:</p>
<blockquote>“In all the literature of fantasy, there are few works so sheerly, purely creative as THE NIGHT LAND.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The ultimate saga of a fantasy world beleaguered by eternal night and by the unvisageable spawn of darkness.”</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, I had to have these books. I bought them there and then.</p>
<p>Once home, I retired to my room, ensconced myself in an armchair and started to read volume one. I instantly found myself transported to a world of nightmare. Outside, the summer sun shone brightly, but in my head, all was darkness. Despite Hodgson’s unwieldy prose and clumsy archaisms, a deep foreboding crept from the chill and lightless pages of THE NIGHT LAND and when, early in the story, the narrator heard a door open in the air above him, I found that I was holding my breath.</p>
<p>It was only later that day that I went back and read Lin Carter’s introduction to the book. Already enchanted by what I had read of the novel, I was deeply disappointed to discover that this was, in fact, an abridged edition. The completist in me would allow me to go no further. I put the book aside and did not attempt to read THE NIGHT LAND again until some years later when I came across the 1979 unabridged Sphere paperback edition in the basement of Dillons University Bookshop in London’s Torrington Place. This I purchased and devoured in guilty delight. I should have been researching Renaissance literary theory and the influence of Greek romance, but instead I found every opportunity to join Hodgson’s far-future hero as he made his lonely way across the haunted plains and dry and sunless seabeds of Earth’s final and enduring night.</p>
<p>Hodgson’s works stay with you for a lifetime and when I read that the Night Land website was calling for fresh fictions set in his world, I immediately decided to have a go at drafting my own episode in the saga.</p>
<p>My short story “Parting” stands on a shaky tripod of purposes, prompts and pretexts.</p>
<p>Firstly, I wanted to write a “Just So Story” explanation for the existence of the fearsome Night Hounds in the Night Land.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wanted to explain the presence of the wrecked and ancient air vessel which the narrator encounters, spiked through on a rock in the Country of Fire and Water.</p>
<blockquote>Yet, presently was I come nigh under the bottom of the ship; and here I did perceive that she had been sore battered in that far-off age when she did come upon the Rock; for, surely, as I did perceive, the peak of the Rock was through the bottom of the ship, so that the metal was burst this way and that, and very plain to be seen in some parts; but in other places the earth and growing matters did make a hiding.</blockquote>
<p>The narrator can only speculate on how the vessel came to be there:</p>
<blockquote>And surely, it did seem to me as I went downward of the great Rock, how that the flying-ship had been there for an hundred thousand years; and that mayhaps the sea did live all about the Rock in that Age; and truly this was no improper thing to think, for it was like that the sea had been monstrous high and great in those days; so that the Rock was but a little island in the midst of the sea; and now was the sea gone small from a great sea to lesser seas, and this through an eternity of years. And always, as it doth seem to me, had the ship lain upon the Rock, and lookt quiet and silent over the change and wonder and the lonesomeness of all that Country of Fire and water, for ever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But how the air-ship did come upon the rock, how shall I know; save, maybe, it doth seem as that she might have flown low over the sea in that olden age, and come hard upon the Rock, because, maybe, there was one to the helm that did steer unwittingly. And again, it shall well be otherwise, and I do but set down mine odd thoughts; and such as they be, they have no especial use, save that they do show to you the different workings of my mind at that time, as I did go downward.</blockquote>
<p>Others may have a different explanation for the fate of the doomed flying-ship, but “Parting” gives mine.</p>
<p>And thirdly, I wanted in this story to establish the distant background for a novella I was writing, set much later in the chronology of the Night Land and entitled “Footfalls echo in the memory”.</p>
<p>Finally, I ought to acknowledge that the City by the Lake of Bronze referred to in “Parting” is the invention of Keran Parizek and appears as a location in her fine Night Land story “<a href="https://nightland.website/index.php/stories/night-land-stories/3-red-twilight">Red Twilight</a>”.</p>]]></description>
